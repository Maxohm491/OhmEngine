# Ohm Engine

A lightweight and flexible 2D game engine built by me, from scratch, with **Dlang**. Designed for developers who want a simple framework to create any kind of 2D game. I created it for my own personal use, but feel free to use any or all of my code if you find it helpful.

## Why Dlang?
D is a general-purpose systems programming language that was originally designed as a re-regineering of C++, although it's grown far past that nowadays. Learn about it [here](https://dlang.org/)! I chose it for this project because I think it's very underused for game development. It offers all of the speed and low-level control of something like C++, while also having useful features like array slicing, an (optional) garbage collector, and compile-time execution for certain functions. 

## Features

- **Sprite Rendering & Animation**  
  Load, manage, and animate sprites with a smooth frame system.
  
- **Collision Detection**  
  Built-in collision management for both simple and complex objects.

- **Flexible Scripting**  
  Integrate game logic and behaviors with a clear scripting interface.
  
- **Extensible Architecture**  
  Modular design for adding custom systems, tools, and workflows.

## Usage
I made a lovely game called Boing with this game engine. The video above shows gameplay from it, and the full code and further details can be found [here](https://github.com/Maxohm491/Boing).

If you're looking to use the engine yourself, you'll need a D compiler and **dub**, the official D package manager. Both can be downloaded [here](https://dlang.org/). The engine also relies on [Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://www.libsdl.org/) 2, the popular open source library that provides an abstraction layer for multimedia hardware components like screens and keyboards.
